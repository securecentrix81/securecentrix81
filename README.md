**Okay so I know this is going to sound totally crazy and you're probably going to think I'm being dramatic but I SWEAR this is actually serious and I really need to talk to you about what happened after third period today because honestly I'm still kind of processing it and I don't even know where to start but basically you know how we were talking yesterday about that whole situation with you-know-who and you-know-what, and I was like "yeah whatever it'll be fine" but then TODAY during passing period I saw something that literally made me stop in the middle of the hallway and just stand there like a complete idiot while everyone was walking around me and I'm pretty sure someone actually bumped into me but I didn't even notice because I was so shocked, and the thing is I can't even really explain it without it sounding absolutely insane but trust me when I say that if you had been there you would have COMPLETELY understood why I immediately pulled out my phone to text you except then I realized that this was way too important for texting so I decided to wait until I got home to email you, and I know you're probably reading this thinking "Saharsh what the heck are you even talking about" but I promise it all makes sense, well actually maybe it doesn't make sense which is kind of the whole problem, and I really hope this doesn't change anything between us because we're good, right? Like I know we haven't really talked about it directly but I just want to make sure we're good, right? Anyway the point is that what I saw connects to that thing from last week and also possibly that other thing from the assembly, and I'm honestly not even sure if I should be telling you this or if I should just pretend I never saw anything but that seems wrong somehow, plus I feel like you deserve to know since you're kind of involved in a way, not directly involved obviously but involved enough that it matters, and I was thinking about maybe bringing it up tomorrow at lunch but then I thought maybe that's too public and we should talk about it somewhere more private, or maybe I should just forget about the whole thing entirely because now that I'm actually writing this email I'm starting to wonder if I'm making a bigger deal out of this than it actually is, but then again my mom always says I have good instincts about people and situations even though she also says I'm too paranoid sometimes which is kind of contradictory if you think about it, and speaking of my mom she almost saw me writing this email because she walked into my room without knocking AGAIN even though we've had like seventeen conversations about privacy and boundaries, and I had to quickly switch tabs to that history essay I'm supposed to be working on which by the way is due Friday and I haven't even started it yet but that's a whole other thing, anyway where was I, oh right so the thing I saw in the hallway was actually kind of related to what Jordan told me last Tuesday or maybe it was Wednesday, I can't remember exactly but it was definitely one of those days, and Jordan was acting super weird about it too like they kept looking over their shoulder and talking really quietly even though we were in the library and literally nobody cares what anyone says in the library, and at the time I thought Jordan was just being paranoid but NOW after what I saw today I'm thinking maybe Jordan was right to be cautious, and this is where it gets really complicated because if Jordan was right about that then that means the thing that happened at Sara's party might not have been a coincidence after all, and I know you said you didn't want to talk about Sara's party anymore and I totally respect that but I feel like this is different because it's new information that could change everything, or maybe it changes nothing and I'm just connecting dots that aren't supposed to be connected, like my dad does with his conspiracy theories about the school board which are honestly embarrassing and I really hope nobody at school knows about his whole Nextdoor posting situation, but anyway getting back to the main point if there even is a main point anymore because I feel like I've been writing this email for like twenty minutes and I'm not even sure what I'm trying to say, but basically what happened was I was walking past the science wing right after the bell rang and you know how there's that little alcove near Mr. Peterson's room where people sometimes go to have private conversations or whatever, well I happened to glance over there and I saw you-know-who talking to THEM, like actually talking face-to-face in what looked like a pretty intense conversation, and I know what you're thinking, you're thinking "so what, people talk to each other all the time Saharsh stop being weird" but it's not just that they were talking it's the WAY they were talking, like you-know-who was standing really close and had their hand on THEIR shoulder and they were both looking around like they didn't want anyone to see them, and when you-know-who spotted me looking they immediately stepped back and pretended to be checking their phone like nothing was happening, but I SAW it and I KNOW what I saw and it was definitely suspicious, and this matters because remember how last month you told me that thing about the group chat that you accidentally got added to, well I think this might be related to that same situation except now it's escalated or evolved or whatever you want to call it, and I'm honestly getting kind of worried because what if this is bigger than we thought, what if it's not just drama but like actual serious stuff, although I guess I should clarify what I mean by serious because I don't want you to think someone's in danger or anything, at least I don't THINK anyone's in danger, but then again how would I even know for sure, it's not like I have all the information, I only have the pieces that I've picked up from here and there, and now that I'm really thinking about it maybe I should talk to a teacher or counselor or something, but then what would I even say, "hi I saw two people talking in the hallway and it seemed weird"? They'd think I was insane, plus what if I'm wrong and I make a big deal out of nothing and then everyone gets mad at me, including you, and that's literally the last thing I want because you're honestly one of my best friends and I don't want to mess that up over something that might not even be a real problem, but also what if it IS a real problem and I don't say anything and then something bad happens and I could have prevented it, that would be so much worse, like I would never forgive myself, and I know I tend to overthink things which is what my therapist is always telling me to work on, like she's always saying "Saharsh you need to learn to tolerate uncertainty" and I'm like "yeah okay but what if the uncertain thing is actually bad" and she's like "you can't control everything" and honestly sometimes therapy just makes me more anxious because then I'm anxious about being anxious, but that's getting off track, the point is I saw what I saw and I think it means something but I don't know what exactly, and I was also thinking about how this might connect to that weird Instagram story from two weeks ago, you know the one I'm talking about, the one that got deleted after like ten minutes, and at the time everyone was speculating about what it meant but then everyone just kind of forgot about it because something else happened, I don't even remember what, maybe that thing with the football team, anyway I didn't forget about it and I screenshot it actually which probably makes me seem creepy but I swear I just did it because I thought it was important, and looking at it now with this new context from today it actually makes a lot more sense, like the puzzle pieces are starting to fit together except I still don't know what the final picture is supposed to be, and another thing that's been bothering me is that comment that Alex made in bio class last week, you weren't there because you had that dentist appointment but Alex said something really cryptic about loyalty and trust and I didn't think much of it at the time but now I'm wondering if that was directed at someone specific, maybe even at you-know-who, and if it WAS directed at them then what does that mean about the whole situation, like is there some kind of conflict happening that I'm not fully aware of, and why wouldn't you have told me about it unless maybe you don't know about it either which seems unlikely because you usually know everything that's going on, you're like the most connected person I know, but then again maybe this is happening in a different social circle that we're not part of, which would actually explain a lot now that I think about it, and oh my god I just remembered something else, remember how last Friday someone left that note in your locker and you showed it to me but we couldn't figure out who wrote it, what if THAT was related to this too, what if someone was trying to warn you about something, and I know the note was kind of vague and could have meant anything but what if it specifically meant THIS, whatever this is, and I'm also thinking about the fact that you-know-who has been acting different lately, like more secretive and distracted, and I mentioned that to you before but you said I was reading too much into it, and maybe I was, or maybe I was picking up on something real and neither of us realized it at the time, and honestly this whole thing is making me feel kind of paranoid like maybe I'm being watched or something, which I know sounds totally ridiculous but after what happened today I just have this weird feeling, like that feeling you get when you know something is off but you can't quite put your finger on what it is, and my older sister says I should trust my gut more because apparently I'm pretty intuitive even though I never give myself credit for it, but my gut is telling me like five different things right now so that's not super helpful, and I really wish I could just talk to you about this in person instead of writing this extremely long email that you're probably not even going to read all the way through, I mean I wouldn't blame you if you just skimmed it or even deleted it because at this point even I'm losing track of what I'm trying to say, but I've already written so much that I might as well keep going, and plus there are still a few more things I need to mention, like the fact that I saw THEM again after school today in the parking lot and they were getting into someone's car, not their usual ride, and I couldn't see who was driving but the car was that dark blue Honda that's always parked in the senior lot, you know the one with all the stickers on the back, and I've seen that car before but I can't remember whose it is which is driving me crazy, and I tried to take a picture but my phone was in my backpack and by the time I got it out they were already driving away, so now I have literally zero proof of anything I'm telling you which I realize makes this whole email seem even more unhinged, and maybe it is unhinged, maybe I'm having some kind of stress-induced breakdown from all the AP classes and college application pressure, my parents keep pushing me to do more extracurriculars and get better grades and it's honestly exhausting, but no I don't think that's it, I think what I saw was real and significant, or at least I'm pretty sure it was, like maybe seventy-five percent sure, or sixty percent, honestly the more I think about it the less sure I become which is really frustrating, and I just want to know what you think because you're always really logical and level-headed about stuff like this, unlike me who just spirals and overthinks everything until I can't even remember what was real and what I imagined, and that's another thing my therapist and I are working on, separating facts from interpretations, and the facts are: I saw two people talking in the hallway, they looked like they didn't want to be seen, one of them is relevant to our previous conversations, and later I saw one of them getting into an unfamiliar car, those are the facts, everything else is interpretation and speculation, but isn't speculation sometimes important, isn't that how people figure things out, by taking limited information and trying to make sense of it, detectives do it all the time, although I guess detectives also have training and experience and actual authority whereas I'm just a high school student who probably watches too many true crime documentaries, but still I think my concerns are valid even if I can't fully articulate them, and I really hope you don't think less of me after reading this because I know I sound absolutely ridiculous and paranoid and possibly unwell, but I promise I'm fine, I'm totally fine, I'm just confused and concerned and maybe a little bit scared although I'm not sure what I'm scared of exactly, maybe I'm scared of being wrong, or scared of being right, or scared that something is happening that I don't understand and can't control, and you know how I get when I feel like things are out of my control, I just start spiraling and catastrophizing and imagining worst-case scenarios, and I'm definitely doing that right now, like part of my brain is convinced that this is all connected to some huge conspiracy and another part of my brain is like "Saharsh calm down it's literally nothing" and I don't know which part to listen to, and this is why I need to talk to you because you can help me figure out if I'm being rational or irrational, and I promise I'll listen to your perspective even if you think I'm being totally ridiculous, I just need someone to help me process this, and it has to be you because you're the only person who knows enough context to understand what I'm talking about, anyone else would be completely lost, I mean my other friends are great but they're not really involved in this whole situation so they wouldn't get it, and I can't talk to my parents about it because they already think I'm too invested in "drama" as they call it, even though this isn't drama it's legitimate concern about a legitimate situation, or at least I think it is, and wow I just looked at how long this email has gotten and I'm honestly impressed with myself for writing this much, like this is more than I wrote for my entire English essay last week, maybe I should channel this energy into my actual schoolwork, but anyway I think I'm finally getting to the end of what I wanted to say, or maybe I'm just running out of things to say, it's hard to tell, but basically I just need to know: did you notice anything weird today, have you talked to you-know-who recently, do you think I should be worried, and most importantly are WE okay because I feel like I might have said some things in here that could be interpreted in different ways and I don't want you to think I'm accusing you of anything or leaving you out of anything or being weird about our friendship, I'm just trying to be honest and transparent about what I'm experiencing and thinking, and I hope you can appreciate that even if you think I'm being overdramatic, which you probably do, which is fine, I can handle that, I just need to hear it from you directly, so please please please respond to this email as soon as you can because I'm going to be obsessively checking my inbox every five minutes until you do, and if you don't respond by tomorrow morning I'm probably going to assume you're mad at me or think I'm crazy or both, and then I'll send you like three follow-up emails apologizing, so really you'd be doing us both a favor by just responding quickly, even if it's just a short response saying "Saharsh you're overthinking this" because at least then I'd KNOW instead of just wondering and spiraling, and also if you want to talk on the phone instead of emailing back that would be totally fine too, actually that would probably be better because then we could have an actual conversation instead of this one-sided rambling that I've been doing, and I promise if we talk on the phone I'll let you actually speak and I won't just talk over you the whole time, even though I know I have a tendency to do that when I'm anxious, but I'm working on it, I swear, anyway I think I really am done now, unless I think of something else in the next thirty seconds, okay no I think that's everything, wait actually one more thing, if you see you-know-who tomorrow can you just like observe them and see if they're acting weird, you don't have to say anything or do anything just observe and report back to me, is that okay, I feel like that's not asking too much, okay NOW I'm really done, I'm going to stop typing and actually send this email before I delete the whole thing and convince myself not to send it, okay here goes nothing, wait are we good though, like seriously are we good, okay sorry I'll stop, you know what, never mind.**
